              <p>To get started, here are a few baseline statistics about active learning from your most recent session. Increases in these numbers are a great indication that you're improving your learner engagement strategies.</p>

              <p>Below is some personalized feedback from GPT-4 on your session. This feedback was generated by reviewing your session transcript and looking for opportunities to implement strategies that past SAT tutors have found to be effective.</p>
              
              <div className="feedback-box">
                <p style={{backgroundColor: "#e3f2fd"}}>You provided a detailed explanation of many problems, which is great. However, I noticed a moment when you could have given more space for learners to verbalize their thoughts. For instance, towards the end of the session, you ask Learner8 to go over a particular problem. She admits to not understanding it and you then proceed to explain the problem in great detail yourself. Instead, you might have asked Learner8 what specifically was confusing about the question, or asked her to share her thought process when she approached it. This would have given her the opportunity to articulate and address her struggles with the problem, fostering a "we do" learning environment.</p>
